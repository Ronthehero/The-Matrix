  <div>  
      <h1>The Story Of My Life</h1>  
      <p>How it all started was...</p>  
      <p>I was born on October 15, 2013. <b>Everything</b> was peaceful.</p>  
      <p>I was born in Thailand (also known as Bangkok). Ever since I was in Bangkok, I've encountered video games. The first video game I played was Subway Surfers. The game was so much fun that I encountered more video games which I could not stop playing.</p>  
      <p><i>A few years later</i>, I moved to India with my family.</p>  
      <p>In India, I've played games like Dancing Line, Rolling Sky, UNO, Piano Tiles 2™, Plants vs Zombies, and more.</p>  
      <p>Ever since I've played lots of games, they have made me feel inspired and determined to create games. So I asked my mom, "How do I code?" She then installed a coding practice app on my phone, and I was learning bit by bit. <i>After a few years...</i> I've finally learned Blockly, JavaScript, Python and HTML (well, not fully) (and I've started practicing coding since 2021).</p>  
      <p>I spend some time with my friends and family, and I have fun with them.</p>  
      <p>Sometimes I even code using W3Schools and Mimo. Usually, W3Schools feels a bit boring but it's one of my coding-pathways, on the other hand Mimo feels fun like a game. I will continue to learn many coding and scripting languages.</p>

    <h1>Cyber Education 1</h1>  
    <p>It all started back then when i was 5 or 6 or 7 where on yt i saw people hacking devices with just usbs that automatically run spripts when plugged in</p>  
    <p>Then i saw that people were hacking with just smartphones and then I heard of Kali Linux... And then this cyber trip of time happened few days after i became 11 years old (I was in 5th std by that time)</p>  
    <p>When it started... I installed a command-line-interface based on the Linux kernel, I figured out online how to use it and soonly after... <i>I installed so many cyber-tools</i></p>  
    <p>I also figured out how to use the tools and what are their purposes, then I learnt cyber-attacks like for example : DDoS, DoS, probe, deauthentication, dictonary, password-list, dns poisoning, evil-twin, dns re-routing, hash decryption, BIOS infection, bruteforce, metasploit-framework, backdoor, phishing, MITM, arp poisoning, arp spoofing, WPA attacks and so many more!</p>  
    <p>I also learnt cryptography, you may be wondering what is cryptography, cryptography is basically just encryption and decryption then I learnt port scanning, I used it for DDoS attacks back then</p>  
    <p>Eventually... My parents fount out I became a hacker, my dad was impressed knowing this and then i got into schoolerships of cyber-courses then I learnt the different types of hackers : White hat hackers are ethical hackers that defend with security, and Black hat hackers are unethical hackers that dont defend anyone and hacks others and does cyber-attacks <b>and what did i become...?</b></p>  
    <p><i>I became a Grey hat hacker - A hacker that decides to be ethical or unethical in certain cyber situation who's both good and bad, as i know... <u>these paths are inter-changeable</u></i></p>  
    <p>Not to mention but I'm not just a hacker, I'm also a one of CyberSecurity</p>  
  </div>

<section id="Cyber-Edu-pt2">  
  <div>  
    <h1>Cyber Education 2</h1>  
    <p>Eventually... I got Kali Linux in a Virtual Machine but... <i>that wasn't the only linux distro for hacking...</i> There were other distros like BlackArch snd Parrot-OS, I also got Parrot-OS in a Virtual Machine, I plan on also getting BlackArch someday</p>  
    <p>Then I learnt social engineering and network packet monitoring, Examples of packet monitoring : Wireshark and Stratoshark, Then I learnt Information gathering</p>  
    <p>Then I learnt steganography, steganography is when there's a hidden message, for example : hidden messages in filenames, photos, videos and so on</p>  
    <p>Then I discovered that people made wifi maurauders with esp32 and esp8266 boards so I decided to make one by flashing the firmware to the board, during the process I learnt how to install, remove and update device drivers via device manager, then i tested it and guess what? It actually worked!</p>  
    <p>Then I heard of BackTrack Linux, It was the past of Kali Linux until it changed into Kali Linux in BackTrack 6, I like to call BackTrack Linux as <i>the prototype</i> of Kali Linux, I would've gotten BackTrack but it's outdated so I decided not to</p>

    <h1>A Story</h1>  
    <p>Once upon a time... there were 2 people, one was like a friend to the other... Until one day... <i>A digital havoc ignited in the matrix</i></p>  
    <p>Peace has been disrupted in the matrix.... after that, legends claimed that the ignition were to happen, once again, <i>but this time...</i></p>  
    <p><b>Something unexpected happened,</b> peace has returned to the matrix and they apologized for the past ignition but... <b><u>their mission wasn't done there just yet</u> as few legends still claimed that it would still ignite</b>, They were on a mission to fix the past but it was only fixed by 75% instead of 100%...</p>  
    <p>The remains of their mission was to make them understand that it wouldn't happen... <i>They swore to their last breath that they'd finish what they started/what's about to be done... They swore they would fix the past <b>AND THEY SWORE TILL' THEIR LAST BREATH!</b></i></p>  
    <p>Temporary end of the line - To be continued...</p>
